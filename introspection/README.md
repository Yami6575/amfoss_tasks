# Why must we choose you?
I am a great match for this position in terms of my work ethic and passion for open-source and competative programming,but more importantly i know the importance of being a part of a community of like minded people that is very reason i have joined amrita amritapuri.The efficiency of work and support we get from being a part of a community is a completey different from doing stuff on our own these are the reasons why i think u should choose me to be part of this wonderful community.
# What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I am planning to give an attempt for google summer of code(gsoc)2023 and do competative programming simultaniously,eventually i will try to manage both but eventually i would choose one path to do very well in either devlopment or cp depending upto my interests and skills at that point these are my plans for the next few months
# How would you contribute back to the club? 
I would like to contribute back to the club by mentoring my juniors in the future in club,would like to conduct events like the hacktober fest which i myself attended.Mentoring has always has been a big part of my life i have mentored my own sister,helping juniors in school ,appartment and etc... in the all sorts of fields 

# Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
I personally really like the selection process I initially used to think why are we made to work on all different fields and languages but now i have realized that it was just to give us a basic idea of all fields and go deeper in any of the fields we are interested in.But i still havent figued my field of interest yet, i hope atleast in the future i by the guidance of my fellow seniors and myself interest i will be able to choose my field of interest
