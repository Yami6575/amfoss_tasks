# Tough Grind
This was probably my most toughest task even through i found a very similar project online,still i had to learn a lot, i read little bit of documentation of flutter, watched a few videos on flutter ,watched few videos of craig oda related to flame.

Here is a working demo of my final project: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116485921/206874759-cd438a47-842d-4ab6-99b9-22e0e6013168.webm
